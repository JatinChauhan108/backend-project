# JWT
- An access token secret is added to the environment variable, which can be generated from sha256 or written by self
- A complex string is always generated according to industry standards
- Access token expiry is also written in environment variables which refers to the time, for which the token will remain valid.
- If we write 1d, it means the token will expire after 1 day.
- More types of syntax for mentioning the time can be found in the documentation.
- Refresh token secret is also added in env var, in which as well a complex string is added similar to access token secret.
- Refresh token expiry is always set more than access token expiry
- Only refresh token is stored in database and not access token
- Access token and refresh token both are jwt tokens but are used differently
- Refresh token generation is similar to access token, but payload is given less in case of refresh token, as it keeps getting refreshed.
